express-session - it is a middleware package which is responsible for making a session (ie creating a unique session id for the user and sending it in a cookie to the client)
cookie-parser - it is a express middleware for parsing the cookie sent from the client into request.cookie object. 
difference between cookie and session id--
cookie stores the preferences of the user which also includes the session id whereas session id is a unique identifier


nodelogin.sql - contains all the sql commands which are important. 



-- Creating a local variable with DECLARE/SET syntax.  



CREATE TABLE users
(
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);



CREATE TABLE verify
(
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

Challenge 1 : during connecting with the mysql server. 

Since the root password was not accepting in the mysql server because I have not started the server. And not set the root password for it. But for the safety reasons I created an other user which and granted all the required privileges for using the database 




Challenge 2: during signup and verification of the token , there were many syntax errors like I was not using ‘ ‘ for string variables so i did that. After than i realised that there is no method written for creating the the verification and users table. Then I did that manually using sql shell.


Used the etherial email service for nodemailer



challenge 2 - cannot attach cookie to the request after signin is successful , on login the request we got that , it was not attaching the cookie to the response during login,


 

Solution - we also need to add the cookie parser for attaching the cookies to the request headers and session

Sure, here are 5 brief resume points for your hospital management system project:

1. Developed a hospital management system application using EJS as the template engine for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js framework for the backend, and MySQL database.
2. Implemented user authentication using session storage through cookies (stateful).
3. Implemented CRUD operations on all data, including doctors, employees, appointments, salary, and complaints.
4. Implemented token-based authentication using Ethereal email to send verification tokens to users.
5. Used Nodemailer to send emails.

In addition to these points, I would also highlight the following in my resume:

* Production quality code: The code was written to a high standard and was well-tested.
* MVC architecture: The application was designed using the MVC architecture, which makes it easy to maintain and extend.
* Experience with a variety of technologies: The project gave me the opportunity to work with a variety of technologies, including Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, EJS, and Nodemailer. This experience has made me a more well-rounded developer.

I believe that this project demonstrates my skills and experience in software development. I am confident that I can use my skills to contribute to your team and help you achieve your goals.
